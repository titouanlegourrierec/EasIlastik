    ==========
    
    This module provides functionalities to simplify the usage of Ilastik models in Python.
    
    Provides
      1. A user-friendly interface to load and use pre-trained Ilastik models in Python applications.
      2. Seamless integration with Python to create custom workflows for image processing.
      3. Support for single image files or image folders.
      4. Robust error handling mechanisms to facilitate debugging and issue resolution when using Ilastik models.
    
    How to use the documentation
    ----------------------------
    Documentation is available in two forms: docstrings provided with the code, and a standalone reference guide available from the `EasIlastik homepage : https://github.com/titouanlegourrierec/EasIlastik/wiki`.
